gdpc 1.0.1
==============

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug in auto.gdpc that arose when the user chose normalize = 2. The loadings and intercepts were
  being correctly adjusted only for the first component.

* Explicitly cast N and m as double when computing crit. This should fix an installation bug in Solaris.
